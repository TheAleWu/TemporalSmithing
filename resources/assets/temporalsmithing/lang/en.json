It enables you to awaken your weapons, armor, jewellery and so on by adding awakenings onto them. You will have to craft yourself this block to get started.\n\n<font weight=\"bold\" lineheight=\"1.2\" align=\"center\">Smithing Table Interface</font>\nWhen opening the GUI of the Smithing Table you will be greeted by two slots on the top. Into the right slot you will put your desired item that should be awakened. The left slot is used to insert an awakening or get back the item of the awakening that you removed from your awakened item. If the item in the right slot has at least one awakening slot unlocked (see <strong>Unlock Awakening Slots</strong>) then it will also show all the awakening slots inside the scrollable window below.\n\n<font weight=\"bold\" lineheight=\"1.2\" align=\"center\">Applying an awakening</font>\nTo apply an awakening item you will need a hammer. Any hammer is possible. With this you start hammering onto the table. After a certain amount of hits the awakening item is applied.\n\n<font weight=\"bold\" lineheight=\"1.2\" align=\"center\">Removing an awakening</font>\n<font color=\"#eb7200\" weight=\"bold\">Warning: Removing an awakening can be a expensive operation as it is not guaranteed to get back the original awakening item. This means you will just free up a slot, but damage your tools and possible lose the awakening!</font>\nTo remove an awakening you must first select the desired awakening inside the Smithing Table. It will be visualized by it being crossed out. Afterwards you put any hammer inside your off-hand slot and a chisel into your main hand. Now you hold your left mouse button onto the smithing table. After a certain amount of hits the awakening will be removed.\n<strong>Important:</strong> Temporal Containers can not be removed once they have been applied onto an item!\n\n<font weight=\"bold\" lineheight=\"1.2\" align=\"center\">Unlock Awakening Slots</font>\nTo add awakenings to your items, you must unlock awakening slots first. This is done by applying a Temporal Container onto your desired item with the help of the Smithing Table. Just put it into the left slot and start hammerin'! As soon as you're finished you're ready to go adding matching awakenings. For this check out the guide about <a href=\"handbook://smithing-awakenings-overview\">every available awakening</a>.",

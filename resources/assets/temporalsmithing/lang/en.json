  "guide.smithing-basics.text": "<font align=\"center\"><font size=\"20\" weight=\"bold\" lineheight=\"2\">Basics of temporal smithing</font>\n<font weight=\"bold\" lineheight=\"1.2\">The Smithing Table</font></font>\nThe most important block of this mod is the <a href=\"handbook://block-temporalsmithing:smithing-table\">Smithing Table</a>. It enables you to unleash the hidden powers of your weapons, armor pieces, jewelery, etc. To begin unleashing these powers you will first need to craft this block yourself.\n\n<font weight=\"bold\" lineheight=\"1.2\" align=\"center\">The interface</font>\nWhen interacting with the Smithing Table, you will be greeted by two slots. In the right slot you need to insert the item of which you want to unleash powers. The left slot is used to insert any runes or infusions or to get back already applied runes afterwards. If the item in the right slot has already at least one rune slot unlocked (refer to <strong>Unlocking a rune slot</strong>), then these slots will be shown in the window below.\n\n<font weight=\"bold\" lineheight=\"1.2\" align=\"center\">Applying a rune or infusion</font>\nYou will need any hammer to apply a rune or an infusion. With it in your main hand you have to hammer on the Smithing Table. After a given amount of hammer hits the given rune will be applied or a new rune slot unlocked.\n\n<font weight=\"bold\" lineheight=\"1.2\" align=\"center\">Removing runes</font>\n<font color=\"#eb7200\" weight=\"bold\">Warning: Removing runes may be an expensive endeavor as you are not guaranteed to always get back your rune. This means that although you will make space for another rune, you might damage your tools and not even get back the given rune!</font>\nTo remove a rune, first off select the rune inside the Smithing Table. This is visualized by a cross over the selected rune. Afterwards, put a hammer in your off-hand and a chisel in your main-hand. Then you once again hold down on left-click on the Smithing Table. After a given amount of hits the rune will be removed.\n<strong>Important:</strong> It is not possible to remove Temporal Infusions after they have been applied to any item!\n\n<font weight=\"bold\" lineheight=\"1.2\" align=\"center\">Unlock a rune slot</font>\nTo be able to apply runes onto your items, you will have to unlock rune slots. This can be achieved by inputting a <a href=\"handbook://block-temporalsmithing:temporal-infusion\">Temporal Infusion</a> into the left slot inside the Smithing Table and then start hammering! After the infusion has been applied, you are able to insert any applicable rune into your item. For this, take a look at the explanation for <a href=\"handbook://smithing-awakenings-overview\">all available powers</a>.",
